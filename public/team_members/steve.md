## About Me

I'm a professional rally driver with a passion for pushing the limits of speed and precision on the toughest terrains. My focus is on mastering challenging rally courses, delivering consistent performances, and inspiring the next generation of drivers.

Throughout my career, I’ve competed in national and international rallies, including the iconic Safari Rally, working with skilled navigators and top-tier teams. My core values center on discipline, teamwork, and resilience in the face of unpredictable conditions.

Off the track, I’m dedicated to mentoring young drivers, promoting motorsport in Kenya, and spending time with my family while exploring new adventures.
