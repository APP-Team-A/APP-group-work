## About Me

I'm a junior-year Software Engineering student at USIU-A, dedicated to learning modern web technologies and building impactful digital experiences. My primary focus is on frontend development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, with growing experience in Git-based workflows and team collaboration.

I enjoy turning classroom concepts into practical applications, and I’m always seeking opportunities to contribute to open-source projects, improve my technical writing, and explore developer tools.

Outside of academics and code, I like engaging in hackathons, learning from peers, and exploring the intersection between tech and real-world problem solving.
