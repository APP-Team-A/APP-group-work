## About Me

I’m a Software Engineering student in junior year at USIU-A, passionate about frontend technologies and building real-world solutions. I’m currently diving deep into JavaScript and React, and enjoy experimenting with scalable web development practices.

In my free time, I like exploring new tools, contributing to open-source documentation, and collaborating on side projects with peers.
