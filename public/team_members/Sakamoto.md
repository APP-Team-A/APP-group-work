## About Me

I’m a Full-Stack Engineer with a sharp focus on precision, performance, and clean code — a philosophy shaped by a past no one dares to question. I thrive in high-stakes environments, turning chaos into scalable architecture with quiet efficiency.

In my current role, I specialize in building seamless web experiences using modern JavaScript frameworks, always optimizing for speed, security, and style. I believe great code speaks louder than words — and mine rarely needs refactoring.

When I'm not deep in code, you’ll find me brewing the perfect cup of tea, reading spy novels, or vanishing into the shadows just before the daily standup.
