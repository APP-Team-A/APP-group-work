## About Me

I'm a passionate software developer with a keen interest in full-stack development and data-driven solutions. With a strong foundation in Java, Python, and mobile application development, I enjoy building innovative tools that bridge the gap between users and technology.

I'm particularly skilled in developing Android apps, peer-to-peer networking systems, and performing data analysis with Python libraries like pandas and NumPy. My work focuses on creating practical solutions that address real-world challenges, from decentralized communication systems to ethical technology research.




When I'm not coding or analyzing data, I enjoy staying updated with the latest technology trends, participating in tech ethics discussions, and contributing to projects that make a positive impact on society.
