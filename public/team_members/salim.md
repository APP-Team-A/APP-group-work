## About Me

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with a deep interest in crafting user-focused software using modern web technologies. I specialize in full-stack development with a focus on frontend performance and clean architecture.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked in fast-paced startup environments, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and contributed to both greenfield projects and large-scale refactors. My core values revolve around continuous learning, empathy in code reviews, and building software that has meaningful impact.

Outside of work, I enjoy writing technical articles, contributing to open-source projects, and hiking in nature.
