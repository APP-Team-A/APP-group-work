## About Me

I'm a Full Stack Developer and Machine Learning enthusiast based in Nairobi, Kenya. Over the past three years, I’ve led the frontend development of platforms like Finlingo and built advanced NLP systems for fraud detection across multiple languages.

My passion lies in building software that addresses local challenges — from financial literacy to online safety. I enjoy crafting seamless frontend experiences with React.js and Zustand, and integrating intelligent backends using Python, BERT, and cloud infrastructure.

Outside of work, I explore new AI technologies, write technical documentation, and contribute to digital transformation projects across Africa.
